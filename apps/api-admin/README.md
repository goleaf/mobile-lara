# API/Admin App

`apps/api-admin` is the target home for the Laravel API and Livewire admin
control plane.

Product Vision is defined in `../../docs/product-vision.md`: this app exists
because SaaS authority, tenant control, support, billing, version policy,
reports, audit, and sync decisions must be centralized.

## Product Role

This system owns SaaS authority:

- tenants and tenant lifecycle
- users, roles, permissions, invitations, sessions, and devices
- feature flags and tenant/user overrides
- remote config and app version policy
- maintenance mode and force update rules
- notifications and push registration policy
- records/content API authority
- offline sync acceptance, replay windows, and conflict decisions
- support, billing, reports, audit, and security enforcement

Admin Control Center logic is defined in
`../../docs/admin-control-center-logic.md`. Future API/Admin implementation
must map each tenant, user, role, permission, mobile feature, remote config,
app version, maintenance, force update, sync, notification, report, billing,
and support control to that document before code is written.

Feature Flag Logic is defined in `../../docs/feature-flag-logic.md`. Future
API/Admin implementation must resolve global, tenant, plan, role, permission,
user, app-version, device, cohort, maintenance, and emergency feature decisions
into API outcomes before mobile uses them.

Remote Configuration Logic is defined in
`../../docs/remote-configuration-logic.md`. Future API/Admin implementation
must validate, scope, version, audit, and safely expose resolved mobile config
without letting config become authorization, billing, tenant, or permission
authority.

Mobile Version Control Logic is defined in
`../../docs/mobile-version-control-logic.md`. Future API/Admin implementation
must resolve minimum supported versions, optional updates, forced updates,
maintenance mode, store links, update messages, and outdated-client protection
into mobile-safe API outcomes.

## Current Phase 4 State

This directory is now a Laravel 13 application with a Livewire admin dashboard
shell, the first versioned mobile API route, and a public mobile contract
catalogue.

Implemented foundation:

- `GET /admin/dashboard` renders `App\Livewire\Admin\Dashboard`.
- `/` redirects to `/admin/dashboard`.
- `GET /api/v1/mobile/status` returns the standard mobile success envelope.
- `GET /api/v1/mobile/contracts` returns the v1 mobile contract catalogue.
- `App\Support\Api\MobileApiResponse` centralizes success and error envelopes.
- `App\Support\Api\MobileContractRegistry` centralizes documented contract
  groups and planned routes.
- Blade layouts exist for admin, auth, and dashboard surfaces.
- Reusable admin Blade components exist for section headings and status badges.
- Pest tests cover the dashboard route, root redirect, success envelope, error
  envelope, contract catalogue, and contract Markdown file coverage.

Still pending:

- Admin authentication, tenant scoping, roles, permissions, policies, and audit.
- Domain modules for feature flags, remote config, app versions, sync,
  notifications, records/content, support, billing, and reports.
- Implemented mobile bootstrap endpoint and protected domain routes.

Verification commands for this app:

```bash
composer validate --strict
php artisan route:list --except-vendor
php artisan test --compact
vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent
npm run build
```

Before implementing endpoints or screens, update the relevant contract in
`contracts/api` and keep `docs/implementation-status.md` accurate.

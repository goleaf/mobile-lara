# API v1 Tenancy Contract

Updated: 2026-06-26

Status: partially implemented. Tenant schema, mobile tenant context listing,
tenant switching, bootstrap tenant context, and switch audit events exist;
admin tenant management, invitations, tenant settings UI, and mobile switcher
integration remain pending.

Product Vision is defined in `../../docs/product-vision.md`: this contract
keeps tenant isolation and tenant access controlled by Admin/API while mobile
shows only allowed tenant context.

Product Positioning is defined in `../../docs/product-positioning.md`: this
contract supports the tenant-based product by keeping workspace access and
tenant switching server-controlled.

Core Product Principles are defined in `../../docs/product-principles.md`: this
contract must preserve admin control, API-first communication, tenant isolation,
secure defaults, simple mobile UX, and modular feature expansion.

API-First Principles are defined in
`../../docs/api-first-principles.md`: this contract must keep tenant access,
switching context, response shape, errors, and offline replay checks
server-resolved and tenant-safe.

Documentation-First Architecture is defined in
`../../docs/documentation-first-architecture.md`: tenancy behavior must
document tenant authority, mobile effect, API dependency, offline/online tenant
context, permission ownership, and tenant-boundary risks before implementation.

Target User Roles are defined in `../../docs/user-roles.md`: tenant access and
tenant switching must resolve platform, tenant, invited, suspended, and
guest/pre-login boundaries server-side.

SaaS Value Map is defined in `../../docs/saas-value-map.md`: tenancy contracts
create value by preserving tenant isolation while enabling governed mobile
access, tenant reports, support context, billing visibility, notifications, and
feature flags.

Two-System Boundary Logic is defined in
`../../docs/two-system-boundary.md`: tenant authority stays in Admin/API while
mobile displays current tenant context and switch choices returned by API.

Admin Safety Principles are defined in
`../../docs/admin-safety-principles.md`: dangerous admin actions behind this
contract must be confirmed, audited, impact-previewed, mobile-previewed,
rollback-aware, and tenant-isolated before implementation.

Admin/API Responsibilities are defined in
`../../docs/admin-api-responsibilities.md`: this contract belongs to tenant
management, users and permissions, API contracts, reporting/support/billing
boundaries, and security enforcement.

Mobile Client Responsibilities are defined in
`../../docs/mobile-client-responsibilities.md`: this contract supports tenant
context display, tenant-switch UX where allowed, cache labels, navigation
state, and local feedback without giving mobile tenant authority.

Mobile UX Principles are defined in `../../docs/mobile-ux-principles.md`: this
contract should support mobile-first navigation, simple screens, clear
loading/offline states, thumb-friendly controls, minimum typing, fast actions,
secure sessions, feature visibility, and native permission education.

Mobile App Shell Logic is defined in `../../docs/mobile-app-shell-logic.md`:
shell states must coordinate welcome, authenticated, locked, offline, maintenance, forced update, tenant
switching, sync-in-progress, permission-blocked, and feature-disabled behavior
before implementation.

Mobile Dashboard Logic is defined in `../../docs/mobile-dashboard-logic.md`:
dashboard content must resolve current user context, current tenant, enabled
feature shortcuts, sync/offline status, unread notifications, recent
activity, announcements, and quick actions through API-safe rules before
implementation.

Mobile Settings Logic is defined in `../../docs/mobile-settings-logic.md`:
settings sections for account, tenant, security, notifications, sync,
appearance, permissions, storage, support, legal, and diagnostics must
separate local device control from Admin/API authority and define
offline-disabled behavior before implementation.

Mobile Permission Logic is defined in `../../docs/mobile-permission-logic.md`:
native permission requests for camera, microphone, location, notifications,
files, scanner, biometrics, and secure storage must explain purpose before
prompting, respect feature flags and API authority, avoid disabled-feature
prompts, support denied-permission recovery, and show status in settings before
implementation.

Authentication Principles are defined in `../../docs/authentication-principles.md`:
mobile login must happen through the API only; access and refresh tokens must
use secure storage; refresh, logout, logout-all-devices, tenant selection,
session expiry, offline already-authenticated behavior, and server revocation
must preserve Admin/API authority before implementation.

Mobile App Lock Principles are defined in `../../docs/mobile-app-lock-principles.md`:
the mobile client must lock on security-sensitive lifecycle, timeout,
account, tenant, offline-cache, and admin-policy conditions; require
confirmation for sensitive areas; use biometric or PIN unlock only as local
protection; handle failed attempts, logout, admin-disabled biometrics, and
offline cached data without bypassing Admin/API authority.

Role And Permission Logic is defined in `../../docs/role-permission-logic.md`:
platform, tenant, admin-user, and mobile-user permissions must be resolved by
Admin/API before API access or mobile UI visibility; permissions interact
with feature flags as separate gates; suspended users and suspended tenants
fail closed without bypassing tenant isolation.

Audit Logic is defined in `../../docs/audit-logic.md`:
admin actions, security events, support activity, mobile activity summaries,
API decisions, sync outcomes, and compliance-relevant changes must produce
protected audit history that answers who did what, where it applied, why it
happened, what changed, and how tenant-safe support or compliance review can
understand it.

Data Privacy Principles are defined in `../../docs/data-privacy-principles.md`:
tenant isolation, least privilege, secure local mobile data, secure native
storage, export and deletion boundaries, support access limits, admin
visibility boundaries, privacy-by-default behavior, and mobile diagnostics
privacy limits must protect users and tenants without turning mobile cache,
support views, or audit history into uncontrolled data exposure.

Tenant Lifecycle Logic is defined in `../../docs/tenant-lifecycle-logic.md`:
tenant creation, onboarding, trial, active, suspended, archived,
billing-blocked, deletion/requested deletion, and restore states must be
Admin/API-owned lifecycle decisions that mobile presents as safe,
tenant-scoped, billing-aware, supportable states without inventing local
tenant authority.

Tenant Admin Logic is defined in `../../docs/tenant-admin-logic.md`:
tenant admins may manage tenant-scoped users, invitations, delegated settings,
delegated mobile-feature controls, tenant reports, and tenant support workflows
only inside their tenant; platform-only controls, cross-tenant visibility,
global policy, billing authority, lifecycle authority, app-version policy, and
security posture remain Admin/API-owned boundaries.

Multi-Tenant Mobile Logic is defined in `../../docs/multi-tenant-mobile-logic.md`:
users with more than one tenant choose and remember tenant context through
API-confirmed state; tenant switching, tenant-scoped cache, per-tenant
permissions and feature flags, sync replay, offline behavior, and logout
cleanup must preserve tenant isolation and never turn mobile-local state
into tenant authority.

Offline-First Principles are defined in `../../docs/offline-first-principles.md`:
mobile may use safe cache, drafts, queued intents, sync status, and clear
offline messaging to keep users productive, but protected reads, writes,
conflicts, billing, permissions, feature access, audit, and tenant authority
must wait for API confirmation before becoming trusted.

Offline UX Logic is defined in `../../docs/offline-ux-logic.md`:
offline UX must calmly explain banners, disabled online-only actions,
local drafts, pending indicators, retry, sync success or failure,
saved-local versus synced state, and data-loss prevention whenever
connection changes.

Records/Content Module Logic is defined in `../../docs/records-content-module-logic.md`:
records are tenant-scoped business content with API-owned lifecycle,
notes, attachments, activity, tags, categories, status, offline draft or
sync behavior, admin controls, permissions, feature flags, audit, and
reporting boundaries.

Search Logic is defined in `../../docs/search-logic.md`:
search stays tenant-scoped, permission-aware, feature-controlled,
privacy-preserving, and explicit about local-cache limits versus
API-authoritative results, including recent searches, saved filters, filtering,
sorting, scan-to-search, offline limits, and admin-controlled boundaries.

Forms And Drafts Logic is defined in `../../docs/forms-drafts-logic.md`:
mobile forms must stay simple, validated, autosave-aware, offline-draft
safe, API-submitted, admin-controlled, and explicit about local-save versus
server-accepted state so user work is protected without bypassing authority.

Notifications Logic is defined in `../../docs/notifications-logic.md`:
notification targeting, delivery policy, push behavior, in-app inbox,
read/unread state, deep links, preferences, offline behavior, and tenant or
permission boundaries must remain Admin/API-authoritative and mobile-safe.

Support System Logic is defined in `../../docs/support-system-logic.md`:
support requests, support messages, attachments, tenant context, support-agent
visibility, audit, notifications, and offline support drafts must remain
tenant-scoped, least-privilege, privacy-safe, and Admin/API-authoritative.

Billing And Plan Logic is defined in `../../docs/billing-and-plan-logic.md`:
plan-based access, trial behavior, active/expired/suspended subscription states,
plan limits, feature-flag entitlement ceilings, mobile unavailable-feature states,
and manual admin billing controls must remain Admin/API-authoritative,
tenant-scoped, auditable, and provider-neutral.

Reporting Logic is defined in `../../docs/reporting-logic.md`:
admin measurements, tenant-admin measurements, mobile-visible summaries,
privacy boundaries, date ranges, exports, feature usage, sync health,
notification, support, and billing reports must remain tenant-scoped,
permission-aware, privacy-safe, auditable, and Admin/API-authoritative.

Native Feature Strategy is defined in `../../docs/native-feature-strategy.md`:
NativePHP capability use, logical service boundaries, browser/development
fallbacks, permission education, admin feature-flag control, native failure
UX, and offline sync behavior must remain feature-scoped, tenant-safe,
privacy-aware, fallback-safe, and Admin/API-authoritative.

Camera And Media Logic is defined in `../../docs/camera-media-logic.md`:
photo capture, media selection, media preview, record/support attachments,
offline media storage, upload queues, feature-flag control, permission
denial, size limits, and privacy behavior must remain tenant-scoped,
permission-aware, fallback-safe, queue-safe, privacy-safe, and
Admin/API-authoritative.

Scanner Logic is defined in `../../docs/scanner-logic.md`:
QR/barcode scan-to-search, scan-to-create, scan-to-validate, scan history,
offline scanning, invalid scan handling, duplicate scan handling, admin
feature flags, and camera/permission dependency behavior must remain
tenant-scoped, permission-aware, fallback-safe, offline-clear,
duplicate-safe, privacy-safe, and Admin/API-authoritative.

Geolocation Logic is defined in `../../docs/geolocation-logic.md`:
check-ins, location-attached records, accuracy display, permission
explanation, offline location behavior, privacy boundaries, admin feature
flags, user-facing location understanding, and never-collect rules must
remain tenant-scoped, permission-aware, fallback-safe, offline-clear,
privacy-safe, purpose-limited, and Admin/API-authoritative.

Device, Network, And Diagnostics Logic is defined in `../../docs/device-network-diagnostics-logic.md`:
device information use, network status use, offline detection, diagnostics
export, support troubleshooting context, diagnostics redaction, admin mobile
device visibility, and user-controlled diagnostics sharing must remain
tenant-scoped, permission-aware, support-scoped, privacy-safe, redacted,
audit-ready, and Admin/API-authoritative.

Module Selection Principles are defined in `../../docs/module-selection-principles.md`:
optional industry modules such as field service, logistics, ecommerce,
booking, education, events, support, community/messaging, reports, and AI
assistant must be tenant-enabled, plan-controlled, permission-aware,
mobile-hidden when unavailable, feature-flag-safe, documented before
implementation, and Admin/API-authoritative.

Field Service Logic is defined in `../../docs/field-service-logic.md`:
work order lifecycle, technician mobile flow, check-in/check-out, photos,
notes, future signatures, offline behavior, admin dispatch/control, and
report visibility must remain tenant-enabled, plan-controlled,
permission-aware, offline-clear, evidence-safe, privacy-safe, auditable,
and Admin/API-authoritative.

Booking Logic is defined in `../../docs/booking-logic.md`:
service selection, availability logic, booking requests, confirmation,
cancellation, reschedule, reminders, admin schedule control, tenant rules,
and mobile offline limitations must remain tenant-enabled, plan-controlled,
permission-aware, availability-safe, schedule-conflict-safe, reminder-safe,
offline-limited, privacy-safe, auditable, and Admin/API-authoritative.

Commerce Logic is defined in `../../docs/commerce-logic.md`:
catalog browsing, cart behavior, checkout principles, hosted payment
boundaries, order lifecycle, invoice/receipt principles, subscription
upsell, admin product/control, and mobile offline limitations must remain
tenant-enabled, plan-controlled, permission-aware, price-safe,
inventory-safe, hosted-payment-safe, offline-limited, privacy-safe,
auditable, and Admin/API-authoritative.

Logistics Delivery Logic is defined in `../../docs/logistics-delivery-logic.md`:
delivery job lifecycle, pickup flow, drop-off flow, proof of delivery,
scan validation, location check-in, failed delivery reasons, offline
behavior, and admin monitoring must remain tenant-enabled, plan-controlled,
permission-aware, scan-safe, location-purpose-limited, offline-clear,
privacy-safe, auditable, and Admin/API-authoritative.

Voice Note Logic is defined in `../../docs/voice-note-logic.md`:
recording, pausing, resuming, local saving, record/support attachments,
optional future transcription, offline upload queues, microphone-permission
denial, admin feature flags, privacy, and retention behavior must remain
tenant-scoped, permission-aware, fallback-safe, offline-clear, queue-safe,
privacy-safe, retention-aware, and Admin/API-authoritative.

Sync Lifecycle Logic is defined in `../../docs/sync-lifecycle-logic.md`:
sync moves from bootstrap readiness to pull, push, retry, conflict
resolution, acknowledgement, status communication, manual sync,
background sync, and admin health monitoring while API authority remains
responsible for acceptance, rejection, conflict decisions, and audit.

Conflict Resolution Logic is defined in `../../docs/conflict-resolution-logic.md`:
conflicts happen when local mobile intent and current server truth no
longer align, and resolution must protect user work while API/Admin
authority decides auto-resolution, user choice, admin/support review,
audit meaning, and data-loss prevention.

Admin Control Center Logic is defined in
`../../docs/admin-control-center-logic.md`: this contract must keep tenant
lifecycle, status, isolation, membership, feature availability, billing,
support, report, and sync controls scoped, authorized, auditable, and exposed
to mobile only as resolved API outcomes.

Remote Configuration Logic is defined in
`../../docs/remote-configuration-logic.md`: tenant labels, onboarding copy,
workflow wording, support guidance, cache freshness messages, and safe tenant
presentation may vary by resolved tenant config, but tenant membership,
switching authority, and isolation remain Admin/API authority.

Mobile Version Control Logic is defined in
`../../docs/mobile-version-control-logic.md`: tenant listing, tenant switching,
tenant-scoped bootstrap context, and tenant-specific maintenance or rollout
states must respect supported, deprecated, force-update, blocked, internal-only,
and maintenance-limited app-version policy.

## Purpose

Tenancy endpoints keep tenant authority on the Admin/API system. Mobile may
display and switch allowed tenants, but every server response remains
tenant-scoped and validates membership server-side.

## Implemented Foundation Routes

| Method | Path | Purpose | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/mobile/tenants` | List tenants available to the current user. | mobile token |
| POST | `/api/v1/mobile/tenants/current` | Switch current tenant context. | mobile token |

## Success Data

Tenant list responses return `current_tenant` and `available_tenants`.
Tenant API identifiers are `tenants.public_id`; numeric database IDs are not
sent to mobile.

Each tenant item includes `id`, `name`, `slug`, `status`,
`subscription_state`, `role_summary`, `switchable`, `current`, and
`disabled_reason`.

Tenant switch responses return refreshed tenant context and
`next_bootstrap_required: true`. Permissions, feature flags, remote config,
sync, billing, notification, and version policy still come from the bootstrap
foundation defaults until those modules are implemented.

## Gates

Tenant access is controlled by membership, invitation state, suspended state,
tenant lifecycle, role, permission, subscription, maintenance, and app-version
policy.

## Offline Behavior

Mobile can show the last known tenant and separate local cache by tenant.
Switching tenants requires API confirmation before protected actions use the
new tenant context.

## Audit

Tenant switch, failed tenant switch, invitation acceptance, suspended access,
and cross-tenant denial are audit events.

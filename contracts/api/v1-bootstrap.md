# API v1 Bootstrap Contract

Updated: 2026-06-26

Status: implemented as the Phase 10 foundation endpoint with Phase 7
role-derived permission payloads, Phase 8 feature-flag resolution, Phase 9
remote-config resolution, and Phase 11 app-version/maintenance resolution.
Domain-specific notification, sync, and full permission-management modules
still need to replace the remaining explicit foundation defaults. Subscription
status now comes from the current tenant's Admin/API-owned subscription state.

Product Vision is defined in `../../docs/product-vision.md`: this contract is
the main API path for turning central SaaS control into mobile operating
context.

Product Positioning is defined in `../../docs/product-positioning.md`: this
contract supports the combined product by giving the mobile workforce/client
platform one API-first operating context from the SaaS control center.

Core Product Principles are defined in `../../docs/product-principles.md`: this
contract must preserve admin control, API-first communication, tenant isolation,
secure defaults, simple mobile UX, and modular feature expansion.

API-First Principles are defined in
`../../docs/api-first-principles.md`: this contract must return predictable
operating context for user, tenant, permissions, feature flags, config, version
rules, sync policy, notification policy, support state, and entitlement
outcomes.

Documentation-First Architecture is defined in
`../../docs/documentation-first-architecture.md`: bootstrap context must
document its feature purpose, admin mobile effects, mobile screen dependencies,
online/offline freshness behavior, permission owners, and risks before
implementation.

Target User Roles are defined in `../../docs/user-roles.md`: bootstrap context
must return role-derived capability state and account-state limits as
mobile-safe outcomes.

SaaS Value Map is defined in `../../docs/saas-value-map.md`: bootstrap context
is where stakeholder value first becomes mobile-visible through allowed
features, tenant context, reports, notifications, sync policy, security, and
admin-controlled state.

Two-System Boundary Logic is defined in
`../../docs/two-system-boundary.md`: bootstrap returns Admin/API decisions as
mobile-safe operating context, and cached bootstrap state is never final
authority.

Admin Safety Principles are defined in
`../../docs/admin-safety-principles.md`: dangerous admin actions behind this
contract must be confirmed, audited, impact-previewed, mobile-previewed,
rollback-aware, and tenant-isolated before implementation.

Admin/API Responsibilities are defined in
`../../docs/admin-api-responsibilities.md`: this contract resolves tenant
management, users and permissions, feature control, remote configuration,
mobile version rules, notification policy, billing/subscription, support,
reporting, sync/conflict, and security into one mobile-safe context.

Mobile Client Responsibilities are defined in
`../../docs/mobile-client-responsibilities.md`: this contract supplies the
operating context mobile uses for navigation, cache freshness, sync display,
feature visibility, local feedback, and safe startup recovery.

Mobile UX Principles are defined in `../../docs/mobile-ux-principles.md`: this
contract should support mobile-first navigation, simple screens, clear
loading/offline states, thumb-friendly controls, minimum typing, fast actions,
secure sessions, feature visibility, and native permission education.

Mobile App Shell Logic is defined in `../../docs/mobile-app-shell-logic.md`:
shell states must coordinate welcome, authenticated, locked, offline, maintenance, forced update, tenant
switching, sync-in-progress, permission-blocked, and feature-disabled behavior
before implementation.

Mobile Dashboard Logic is defined in `../../docs/mobile-dashboard-logic.md`:
dashboard content must resolve current user context, current tenant, enabled
feature shortcuts, sync/offline status, unread notifications, recent
activity, announcements, and quick actions through API-safe rules before
implementation.

Mobile Settings Logic is defined in `../../docs/mobile-settings-logic.md`:
settings sections for account, tenant, security, notifications, sync,
appearance, permissions, storage, support, legal, and diagnostics must
separate local device control from Admin/API authority and define
offline-disabled behavior before implementation.

Mobile Permission Logic is defined in `../../docs/mobile-permission-logic.md`:
native permission requests for camera, microphone, location, notifications,
files, scanner, biometrics, and secure storage must explain purpose before
prompting, respect feature flags and API authority, avoid disabled-feature
prompts, support denied-permission recovery, and show status in settings before
implementation.

Authentication Principles are defined in `../../docs/authentication-principles.md`:
mobile login must happen through the API only; access and refresh tokens must
use secure storage; refresh, logout, logout-all-devices, tenant selection,
session expiry, offline already-authenticated behavior, and server revocation
must preserve Admin/API authority before implementation.

Mobile App Lock Principles are defined in `../../docs/mobile-app-lock-principles.md`:
the mobile client must lock on security-sensitive lifecycle, timeout,
account, tenant, offline-cache, and admin-policy conditions; require
confirmation for sensitive areas; use biometric or PIN unlock only as local
protection; handle failed attempts, logout, admin-disabled biometrics, and
offline cached data without bypassing Admin/API authority.

Role And Permission Logic is defined in `../../docs/role-permission-logic.md`:
platform, tenant, admin-user, and mobile-user permissions must be resolved by
Admin/API before API access or mobile UI visibility; permissions interact
with feature flags as separate gates; suspended users and suspended tenants
fail closed without bypassing tenant isolation.

Audit Logic is defined in `../../docs/audit-logic.md`:
admin actions, security events, support activity, mobile activity summaries,
API decisions, sync outcomes, and compliance-relevant changes must produce
protected audit history that answers who did what, where it applied, why it
happened, what changed, and how tenant-safe support or compliance review can
understand it.

Data Privacy Principles are defined in `../../docs/data-privacy-principles.md`:
tenant isolation, least privilege, secure local mobile data, secure native
storage, export and deletion boundaries, support access limits, admin
visibility boundaries, privacy-by-default behavior, and mobile diagnostics
privacy limits must protect users and tenants without turning mobile cache,
support views, or audit history into uncontrolled data exposure.

Tenant Lifecycle Logic is defined in `../../docs/tenant-lifecycle-logic.md`:
tenant creation, onboarding, trial, active, suspended, archived,
billing-blocked, deletion/requested deletion, and restore states must be
Admin/API-owned lifecycle decisions that mobile presents as safe,
tenant-scoped, billing-aware, supportable states without inventing local
tenant authority.

Tenant Admin Logic is defined in `../../docs/tenant-admin-logic.md`:
tenant admins may manage tenant-scoped users, invitations, delegated settings,
delegated mobile-feature controls, tenant reports, and tenant support workflows
only inside their tenant; platform-only controls, cross-tenant visibility,
global policy, billing authority, lifecycle authority, app-version policy, and
security posture remain Admin/API-owned boundaries.

Multi-Tenant Mobile Logic is defined in `../../docs/multi-tenant-mobile-logic.md`:
users with more than one tenant choose and remember tenant context through
API-confirmed state; tenant switching, tenant-scoped cache, per-tenant
permissions and feature flags, sync replay, offline behavior, and logout
cleanup must preserve tenant isolation and never turn mobile-local state
into tenant authority.

Offline-First Principles are defined in `../../docs/offline-first-principles.md`:
mobile may use safe cache, drafts, queued intents, sync status, and clear
offline messaging to keep users productive, but protected reads, writes,
conflicts, billing, permissions, feature access, audit, and tenant authority
must wait for API confirmation before becoming trusted.

Offline UX Logic is defined in `../../docs/offline-ux-logic.md`:
offline UX must calmly explain banners, disabled online-only actions,
local drafts, pending indicators, retry, sync success or failure,
saved-local versus synced state, and data-loss prevention whenever
connection changes.

Sync Lifecycle Logic is defined in `../../docs/sync-lifecycle-logic.md`:
sync moves from bootstrap readiness to pull, push, retry, conflict
resolution, acknowledgement, status communication, manual sync,
background sync, and admin health monitoring while API authority remains
responsible for acceptance, rejection, conflict decisions, and audit.

Conflict Resolution Logic is defined in `../../docs/conflict-resolution-logic.md`:
conflicts happen when local mobile intent and current server truth no
longer align, and resolution must protect user work while API/Admin
authority decides auto-resolution, user choice, admin/support review,
audit meaning, and data-loss prevention.

Admin Control Center Logic is defined in
`../../docs/admin-control-center-logic.md`: this contract must resolve tenant,
user, role, permission, feature, config, version, maintenance, sync,
notification, report, billing, and support controls into scoped, authorized,
auditable, mobile-safe API outcomes.

## Purpose

Bootstrap gives the mobile client one resolved operating context after login,
app start, tenant switch, and manual refresh. It must expose decisions, not raw
admin configuration layers.

## Implemented Route

| Method | Path | Purpose | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/mobile/bootstrap` | Return the current mobile operating context. | mobile token |

## Success Data

The response must include:

- `user`
- `current_tenant`
- `available_tenants`
- `permissions`
- `features`
- `remote_config`
- `app_version`
- `maintenance`
- `subscription`
- `notification_preferences`
- `sync`
- `unread_notification_count`

The current foundation implementation returns real authenticated user,
device-session, current tenant, available tenant membership context, a
server-derived permission payload based on the current active tenant role,
resolved feature-flag outcomes, resolved remote config, and resolved
app-version/maintenance policy, and resolved subscription state. It still
returns explicit disabled or pending states for notifications and sync modules
whose authoritative Admin/API data models are not implemented yet. Mobile must
treat those states as fail-closed outcomes.

`permissions` includes:

- `status`: `resolved` when there is a current active tenant, otherwise
  `no_active_tenant`.
- `source`: currently `tenant_role_registry`.
- `tenant_id` and `current_role` for the role that produced the payload.
- `roles`: tenant-scoped role summaries for available memberships.
- `abilities`: nested boolean capability state for mobile presentation.
- `ability_list`: granted ability keys in dot notation for simple lookups.

## Metadata

`meta` should include `api_version`, `server_time`, `bootstrap_version`,
`config_version`, `features_version`, `subscription_version`, `sync_cursor`,
and freshness timestamps.

## Gates

Bootstrap is constrained by tenant lifecycle, user access state,
permissions, feature flags, remote config, app-version policy, maintenance,
subscription status, notification settings, and sync rules.

## Offline Behavior

Mobile may cache the last successful bootstrap with freshness metadata. Stale
bootstrap cannot grant new authority. If bootstrap is unavailable, mobile must
fail closed for sensitive actions and clearly label cached state.

## Audit

Bootstrap is read-mostly. Audit tenant switch, stale-client denial, suspended
access, forced update, maintenance block, and suspicious device context.

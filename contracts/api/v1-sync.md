# API v1 Sync Contract

Final Consistency Review is defined in `../../docs/final-consistency-review.md`:
all SaaS idea documentation must preserve API-only mobile authority,
admin-controlled configurable features, separated feature flags and remote
config, tenant isolation, clear offline behavior, permission-aware
NativePHP features, logical billing and plan limits, privacy-safe support,
tenant-bound reports, docs-only planning language, no database-field
definitions, and consistent terminology.

Final Optimized SaaS Blueprint is defined in `../../docs/final-optimized-saas-blueprint.md`:
this is the main planning document for product vision, system architecture,
Admin/API logic, mobile-client logic, API principles, tenant principles,
permissions, feature flags, remote config, offline sync, NativePHP features,
notifications, billing, support, reporting, security, release,
and future module expansion principles.

Updated: 2026-06-26

Status: partially implemented. Bootstrap returns resolved sync policy from
tenant settings, remote config, permission state, subscription state, and
maintenance policy. Dedicated sync bootstrap, record pull, record push,
acknowledgement, idempotent replay, conflict responses, and sync event storage
are implemented; admin monitoring and non-record collection replay remain
pending.

Product Vision is defined in `../../docs/product-vision.md`: this contract
supports offline-capable mobile work while Admin/API remains authoritative for
replay, conflicts, and canonical state.

Product Positioning is defined in `../../docs/product-positioning.md`: this
contract is the API-first boundary that makes offline-capable mobile work safer
than a standalone mobile app.

Core Product Principles are defined in `../../docs/product-principles.md`: this
contract must preserve admin control, API-first communication, tenant isolation,
secure defaults, simple mobile UX, and modular feature expansion.

API-First Principles are defined in
`../../docs/api-first-principles.md`: this contract must make queued intents,
idempotency, replay outcomes, conflicts, retry states, mobile errors, and
tenant re-checks first-class API behavior.

Documentation-First Architecture is defined in
`../../docs/documentation-first-architecture.md`: sync behavior must document
offline cache/draft/queue rules, online replay, idempotency, accepted/rejected
outcomes, conflicts, permission owners, support/reporting visibility, and
risks before implementation.

Target User Roles are defined in `../../docs/user-roles.md`: sync replay,
conflict visibility, and offline state must follow role and account-state
boundaries.

SaaS Value Map is defined in `../../docs/saas-value-map.md`: sync contracts
create value when offline work, tenant continuity, support diagnostics,
reports, security, and billing/entitlement checks reconcile through API.

Two-System Boundary Logic is defined in
`../../docs/two-system-boundary.md`: mobile may queue intents and show pending
state, but API replay decides acceptance, rejection, conflict, retry, and
canonical server state.

Admin Safety Principles are defined in
`../../docs/admin-safety-principles.md`: dangerous admin actions behind this
contract must be confirmed, audited, impact-previewed, mobile-previewed,
rollback-aware, and tenant-isolated before implementation.

Admin/API Responsibilities are defined in
`../../docs/admin-api-responsibilities.md`: this contract belongs to conflict
decisions, API contracts, tenant management, users and permissions,
billing/subscription checks, audit history, and security enforcement.

Mobile Client Responsibilities are defined in
`../../docs/mobile-client-responsibilities.md`: this contract supports offline
actions, pending queues, sync status display, conflict presentation, retry
feedback, stale-state warnings, and local draft recovery.

Mobile UX Principles are defined in `../../docs/mobile-ux-principles.md`: this
contract should support mobile-first navigation, simple screens, clear
loading/offline states, thumb-friendly controls, minimum typing, fast actions,
secure sessions, feature visibility, and native permission education.

Mobile App Shell Logic is defined in `../../docs/mobile-app-shell-logic.md`:
shell states must coordinate welcome, authenticated, locked, offline, maintenance, forced update, tenant
switching, sync-in-progress, permission-blocked, and feature-disabled behavior
before implementation.

Mobile Dashboard Logic is defined in `../../docs/mobile-dashboard-logic.md`:
dashboard content must resolve current user context, current tenant, enabled
feature shortcuts, sync/offline status, unread notifications, recent
activity, announcements, and quick actions through API-safe rules before
implementation.

Mobile Settings Logic is defined in `../../docs/mobile-settings-logic.md`:
settings sections for account, tenant, security, notifications, sync,
appearance, permissions, storage, support, legal, and diagnostics must
separate local device control from Admin/API authority and define
offline-disabled behavior before implementation.

Mobile Permission Logic is defined in `../../docs/mobile-permission-logic.md`:
native permission requests for camera, microphone, location, notifications,
files, scanner, biometrics, and secure storage must explain purpose before
prompting, respect feature flags and API authority, avoid disabled-feature
prompts, support denied-permission recovery, and show status in settings before
implementation.

Authentication Principles are defined in `../../docs/authentication-principles.md`:
mobile login must happen through the API only; access and refresh tokens must
use secure storage; refresh, logout, logout-all-devices, tenant selection,
session expiry, offline already-authenticated behavior, and server revocation
must preserve Admin/API authority before implementation.

Mobile App Lock Principles are defined in `../../docs/mobile-app-lock-principles.md`:
the mobile client must lock on security-sensitive lifecycle, timeout,
account, tenant, offline-cache, and admin-policy conditions; require
confirmation for sensitive areas; use biometric or PIN unlock only as local
protection; handle failed attempts, logout, admin-disabled biometrics, and
offline cached data without bypassing Admin/API authority.

Role And Permission Logic is defined in `../../docs/role-permission-logic.md`:
platform, tenant, admin-user, and mobile-user permissions must be resolved by
Admin/API before API access or mobile UI visibility; permissions interact
with feature flags as separate gates; suspended users and suspended tenants
fail closed without bypassing tenant isolation.

Audit Logic is defined in `../../docs/audit-logic.md`:
admin actions, security events, support activity, mobile activity summaries,
API decisions, sync outcomes, and compliance-relevant changes must produce
protected audit history that answers who did what, where it applied, why it
happened, what changed, and how tenant-safe support or compliance review can
understand it.

Data Privacy Principles are defined in `../../docs/data-privacy-principles.md`:
tenant isolation, least privilege, secure local mobile data, secure native
storage, export and deletion boundaries, support access limits, admin
visibility boundaries, privacy-by-default behavior, and mobile diagnostics
privacy limits must protect users and tenants without turning mobile cache,
support views, or audit history into uncontrolled data exposure.

Tenant Lifecycle Logic is defined in `../../docs/tenant-lifecycle-logic.md`:
tenant creation, onboarding, trial, active, suspended, archived,
billing-blocked, deletion/requested deletion, and restore states must be
Admin/API-owned lifecycle decisions that mobile presents as safe,
tenant-scoped, billing-aware, supportable states without inventing local
tenant authority.

Tenant Admin Logic is defined in `../../docs/tenant-admin-logic.md`:
tenant admins may manage tenant-scoped users, invitations, delegated settings,
delegated mobile-feature controls, tenant reports, and tenant support workflows
only inside their tenant; platform-only controls, cross-tenant visibility,
global policy, billing authority, lifecycle authority, app-version policy, and
security posture remain Admin/API-owned boundaries.

Multi-Tenant Mobile Logic is defined in `../../docs/multi-tenant-mobile-logic.md`:
users with more than one tenant choose and remember tenant context through
API-confirmed state; tenant switching, tenant-scoped cache, per-tenant
permissions and feature flags, sync replay, offline behavior, and logout
cleanup must preserve tenant isolation and never turn mobile-local state
into tenant authority.

Offline-First Principles are defined in `../../docs/offline-first-principles.md`:
mobile may use safe cache, drafts, queued intents, sync status, and clear
offline messaging to keep users productive, but protected reads, writes,
conflicts, billing, permissions, feature access, audit, and tenant authority
must wait for API confirmation before becoming trusted.

Offline UX Logic is defined in `../../docs/offline-ux-logic.md`:
offline UX must calmly explain banners, disabled online-only actions,
local drafts, pending indicators, retry, sync success or failure,
saved-local versus synced state, and data-loss prevention whenever
connection changes.

Records/Content Module Logic is defined in `../../docs/records-content-module-logic.md`:
records are tenant-scoped business content with API-owned lifecycle,
notes, attachments, activity, tags, categories, status, offline draft or
sync behavior, admin controls, permissions, feature flags, audit, and
reporting boundaries.

Search Logic is defined in `../../docs/search-logic.md`:
search stays tenant-scoped, permission-aware, feature-controlled,
privacy-preserving, and explicit about local-cache limits versus
API-authoritative results, including recent searches, saved filters, filtering,
sorting, scan-to-search, offline limits, and admin-controlled boundaries.

Forms And Drafts Logic is defined in `../../docs/forms-drafts-logic.md`:
mobile forms must stay simple, validated, autosave-aware, offline-draft
safe, API-submitted, admin-controlled, and explicit about local-save versus
server-accepted state so user work is protected without bypassing authority.

Notifications Logic is defined in `../../docs/notifications-logic.md`:
notification targeting, delivery policy, push behavior, in-app inbox,
read/unread state, deep links, preferences, offline behavior, and tenant or
permission boundaries must remain Admin/API-authoritative and mobile-safe.

Support System Logic is defined in `../../docs/support-system-logic.md`:
support requests, support messages, attachments, tenant context, support-agent
visibility, audit, notifications, and offline support drafts must remain
tenant-scoped, least-privilege, privacy-safe, and Admin/API-authoritative.

Billing And Plan Logic is defined in `../../docs/billing-and-plan-logic.md`:
plan-based access, trial behavior, active/expired/suspended subscription states,
plan limits, feature-flag entitlement ceilings, mobile unavailable-feature states,
and manual admin billing controls must remain Admin/API-authoritative,
tenant-scoped, auditable, and provider-neutral.

Reporting Logic is defined in `../../docs/reporting-logic.md`:
admin measurements, tenant-admin measurements, mobile-visible summaries,
privacy boundaries, date ranges, exports, feature usage, sync health,
notification, support, and billing reports must remain tenant-scoped,
permission-aware, privacy-safe, auditable, and Admin/API-authoritative.

Native Feature Strategy is defined in `../../docs/native-feature-strategy.md`:
NativePHP capability use, logical service boundaries, browser/development
fallbacks, permission education, admin feature-flag control, native failure
UX, and offline sync behavior must remain feature-scoped, tenant-safe,
privacy-aware, fallback-safe, and Admin/API-authoritative.

Camera And Media Logic is defined in `../../docs/camera-media-logic.md`:
photo capture, media selection, media preview, record/support attachments,
offline media storage, upload queues, feature-flag control, permission
denial, size limits, and privacy behavior must remain tenant-scoped,
permission-aware, fallback-safe, queue-safe, privacy-safe, and
Admin/API-authoritative.

Scanner Logic is defined in `../../docs/scanner-logic.md`:
QR/barcode scan-to-search, scan-to-create, scan-to-validate, scan history,
offline scanning, invalid scan handling, duplicate scan handling, admin
feature flags, and camera/permission dependency behavior must remain
tenant-scoped, permission-aware, fallback-safe, offline-clear,
duplicate-safe, privacy-safe, and Admin/API-authoritative.

Geolocation Logic is defined in `../../docs/geolocation-logic.md`:

audit-ready, and Admin/API-authoritative.

Module Selection Principles are defined in `../../docs/module-selection-principles.md`:
optional industry modules such as field service, logistics, ecommerce,
booking, education, events, support, community/messaging, reports, and AI
assistant must be tenant-enabled, plan-controlled, permission-aware,

tenant-enabled, plan-controlled, permission-aware, opt-in-only,
provider-neutral, human-reviewed, privacy-safe, audit-ready,
rate-limited, cost-aware, and Admin/API-authoritative.

Acceptance Principles are defined in `../../docs/acceptance-principles.md`:
every feature must document purpose, admin control, mobile behavior,
API dependency, offline behavior, permission behavior, feature flag
behavior, tenant behavior, error behavior, security behavior, and
documentation requirements before implementation planning begins.

Risk Map is defined in `../../docs/risk-map.md`:
API dependency, offline sync, tenant isolation, mobile secure storage,
NativePHP plugin availability, app store releases, forced updates,
feature flag mistakes, billing restrictions, admin misconfiguration,
support access, privacy, and data conflicts must document prevention
principles and documentation requirements before implementation.

Testing Strategy Principles are defined in `../../docs/testing-strategy-principles.md`:
future tests for API contracts, admin controls, mobile feature visibility,
permissions, feature flags, remote config, authentication, tenant isolation,
offline sync, conflict behavior, native feature fallbacks, notification flows,
billing rules, and app version rules must map to documented authority, risk,
and user-visible behavior before implementation.

Release And Versioning Principles are defined in `../../docs/release-versioning-principles.md`:
API versioning, mobile app versioning, admin releases, feature rollout,
rollback, app store release, forced update, documentation update, and Git
change-history decisions must preserve documented authority, compatibility,
rollback, support, audit, and user-visible behavior before release.

Documentation Audit is defined in `../../docs/documentation-audit.md`:
project documentation for two-system architecture, Admin/API authority, mobile
client execution, API-first communication, feature flags, remote config,
tenancy, permissions, offline sync, NativePHP features, notifications, billing,
support, reports, security, risks, and release principles must use consistent
authority language and resolve contradictions before implementation.

Feature Dependency Map is defined in `../../docs/feature-dependency-map.md`:
major features must document dependencies on authentication, tenant context,
permissions, feature flags, remote config, API availability, offline cache,
NativePHP permissions, subscription plan, and admin settings before
implementation planning or release decisions.

Logistics Delivery Logic is defined in `../../docs/logistics-delivery-logic.md`:
delivery job lifecycle, pickup flow, drop-off flow, proof of delivery,
scan validation, location check-in, failed delivery reasons, offline
behavior, and admin monitoring must remain tenant-enabled, plan-controlled,
permission-aware, scan-safe, location-purpose-limited, offline-clear,

denial, admin feature flags, privacy, and retention behavior must remain
tenant-scoped, permission-aware, fallback-safe, offline-clear, queue-safe,
privacy-safe, retention-aware, and Admin/API-authoritative.

Sync Lifecycle Logic is defined in `../../docs/sync-lifecycle-logic.md`:
sync moves from bootstrap readiness to pull, push, retry, conflict
resolution, acknowledgement, status communication, manual sync,
background sync, and admin health monitoring while API authority remains
responsible for acceptance, rejection, conflict decisions, and audit.

Conflict Resolution Logic is defined in `../../docs/conflict-resolution-logic.md`:
conflicts happen when local mobile intent and current server truth no
longer align, and resolution must protect user work while API/Admin
authority decides auto-resolution, user choice, admin/support review,
audit meaning, and data-loss prevention.

Admin Control Center Logic is defined in
`../../docs/admin-control-center-logic.md`: this contract must keep offline
eligibility, queueable actions, replay windows, retry limits, conflict modes,
stale thresholds, maintenance blocks, and policy decisions scoped, authorized,
auditable, and exposed to mobile only as resolved API outcomes.

Mobile Version Control Logic is defined in
`../../docs/mobile-version-control-logic.md`: sync replay, offline queues,
conflict handling, stale cursors, and maintenance-limited sync behavior must
respect minimum supported versions, forced updates, blocked builds, deprecated
clients, and update-required states before API accepts protected work.

## Purpose

Sync endpoints let the mobile client replay queued local intents and pull
server changes while the Admin/API remains authoritative for acceptance,
conflict decisions, tenant boundaries, and audit.

## Implemented Routes

| Method | Path | Purpose | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/mobile/sync/bootstrap` | Return sync policy and cursors. | mobile token |
| POST | `/api/v1/mobile/sync/push` | Submit queued idempotent record intents. | mobile token |
| GET | `/api/v1/mobile/sync/pull` | Pull record changes after a cursor. | mobile token |
| POST | `/api/v1/mobile/sync/acknowledge` | Acknowledge delivered changes. | mobile token |

## Success Data

Responses return `accepted`, `rejected`, `conflicts`, `server_changes`,
`next_cursor`, `retry_after`, and `sync_policy`.

Push items require stable `client_intent_id` and `idempotency_key` values.
Record push currently supports `create`, `update`, `archive`, `restore`, and
`delete`. Mobile `delete` is accepted as archive instead of hard delete because
mobile hard-delete authority is intentionally not implemented.

Bootstrap currently returns `sync` with `enabled`, `manual_sync_enabled`,
`offline_queue_enabled`, `server_replay_enabled`, `mode`, `reason`,
`max_batch_size`, `retry_after_seconds`, `stale_after_seconds`,
`conflict_policy`, `server_endpoints`, `source`, `resolved_at`, and
`policy_version`. When sync gates pass, `server_replay_enabled` is `true`,
`mode` is `server_replay_ready`, and `server_endpoints.push`,
`server_endpoints.pull`, and `server_endpoints.acknowledge` are true.

Pull returns `server_changes.records` using the same mobile record resource as
the records contract and a `next_cursor` for subsequent requests.

Push stores a `mobile_sync_events` row per idempotency key and returns prior
outcomes unchanged on duplicate replay. Stale `base_sync_version` values return
conflicts with the remote record payload.

## Gates

Sync is controlled by tenant status, user permissions, feature flags, app
version, maintenance, subscription status, remote config, replay window,
payload size, and conflict policy.

## Offline Behavior

Mobile owns the local queue and status presentation. It must not mark an intent
as server-accepted until the API confirms acceptance.

## Audit

Audit pushed intents, accepted writes, rejected writes, conflicts, conflict
resolution, replay abuse, and sync disabling.

## Tests

Current policy and endpoint coverage:

```bash
cd apps/api-admin && php artisan test --compact --filter=MobileSyncPolicyTest
cd apps/api-admin && php artisan test --compact --filter=MobileSyncApiTest
cd apps/mobile-client && php artisan test --compact --filter=MobileSyncApiServiceTest
```

Remaining Phase 14 coverage should verify non-record collections, admin
monitoring, richer retry windows, and full mobile worker integration with the
dedicated push/pull/acknowledge service.
